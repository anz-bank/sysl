Sysl (pronounced "sizzle") is a open source system specification language. Using Sysl, you
can specify systems, endpoints, endpoint behaviour, data models and data
transformations. The Sysl compiler automatically generates sequence diagrams,
integrations, and other views. It also offers a range of code generation
options, all from one common Sysl specification.

The set of outputs is open-ended and allows for your own extensions. Sysl has
been created with extensibility in mind and it will grow to support other
representations over time.
