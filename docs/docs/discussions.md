On this page we've listed some Sysl-related communities that you can be a part of; see the other pages in this section for additional online and in-person learning materials.

## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if you're stuck with a specific error. Read through the [existing questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sysl) tagged with `sysl` or [ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=sysl)!

## Slack

[The Sysl Slack channel](https://anzoss.slack.com/messages/sysl/) is a great place for discussion about best practices and the future of Sysl. If you have specific questions about code, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit.

## GitHub

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl) hosts all the project and issue tracking, plus of course code.

To report a bug, please use our [Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/issues/new/choose).

Or, to be a hero, you can fork Sysl, fix the bug yourself and create a pull request to fix it for everyone. Please have a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
