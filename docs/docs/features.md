As a language, Sysl is focused on capturing information about software systems. Its power comes from the ecosystem of tools (including the `sysl` CLI) that work with Sysl specifications.

This section describes many of the features of those tools in detail:

- **[Diagram generation](gen-diagram.md)** illustrates the contents of Sysl specifications using a variety of standard UML diagrams.

<!-- TODO: * **[Documentation generation](gen-docs.md)** describes how your applications work, and how others can interact with them. -->

<!-- * **[Code generation](gen-code.md)** instantly produces all of the boilerplate code you'll need to get your applications communicating. -->

<!-- * **[Database script generation](gen-db.md)** creates SQL from your data models so you can initialise and migrate your databases according to your specification. -->

<!-- * **[Test rig generation](gen-test.md)** stands up a test environment that conforms to the specification of your system. -->
